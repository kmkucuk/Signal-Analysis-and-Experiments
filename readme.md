This repo belongs to a period when I only coded for data analyses and experiments for an EEG lab. I learned to code with this repo back in the day, so you'll find most of the code here to be awful; just like my recent repos. 

You'll find different cognitive experiments under "experiments" folder, most of which follow the same structure in terms of play loop. Check Flanker or Checkerboard ones for easier code. 

Go to "preprocess" if you look for EEG preprocessing methods. 

You'll find somewhat of a module I created under "signal analysis", I used that for EEG analysis pipelines. You can get some of the advanced EEG connectivity methods there. 

You'll find EEG and other data visualization methods under "plot". 

Data restructuring/indexing functions can be found under "shape_data". 

You can find some basic statistical methods under "statistics" (e.g. calculating F effect).
